# Accordion
The accordion component allows users to expand or collapse sections of content. Itâ€™s commonly used to organize information in a compact, accessible way. Each section typically has a header that can be clicked to toggle the visibility of its associated content.

```php
@php
    $items = [
        [
            'title' => 'What makes Tabler different from other UI frameworks?',
            'body' => 'Tabler offers a modern, responsive design with a clean aesthetic, built on Bootstrap for ease of use and flexibility.'
        ],
        [
            'title' => 'How can I customize Tabler components to fit my design needs?',
            'body' => 'You can customize Tabler components using CSS variables, SCSS, and utility classes to match your design preferences.'
        ]
    ];
@endphp

<x-tabler-accordion :items="items" />
```
